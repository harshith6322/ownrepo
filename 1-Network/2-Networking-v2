# 🟦 **NETWORKING INTERVIEW NOTES (Q&A Format, 3–4 Line Answers)**

---

# 🔵 **1️⃣ BASICS OF NETWORKING**

---

### **Q1. What is an IP Address?**

An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device on a network so it can communicate with other devices. It follows the Internet Protocol, which defines rules for sending and receiving data. IPs ensure that data reaches the correct destination on networks and the internet.

---

### **Q2. What is IPv4 vs IPv6?**

IPv4 uses a 32-bit format and supports about 4.3 billion unique addresses. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address space, providing trillions of unique addresses to overcome IPv4 exhaustion. IPv6 also adds improved routing efficiency and security features like IPSec by default.

---

### **Q3. What is Public vs Private IP?**

A public IP is globally unique and used to communicate over the internet. A private IP is used only within internal networks (LAN), and cannot be reached directly from the internet. Private ranges: 10.x.x.x, 172.16–31.x.x, 192.168.x.x.

---

### **Q4. What is Subnetting?**

Subnetting divides a large network into smaller logical networks, helping improve performance, security, and IP allocation. It reduces broadcast traffic and organizes devices into manageable groups. It also helps control routing within a network.

---

### **Q5. What is CIDR?**

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) represents IP ranges using a suffix like /24 or /16. It defines how many bits are used for the network portion. CIDR makes IP allocation flexible compared to old class-based networks.

---

### **Q6. What is a MAC Address?**

A MAC address is a 48-bit hardware ID burned into the NIC (Network Interface Card). It uniquely identifies a device at Layer 2 of OSI. Switches use MAC addresses to forward frames to correct devices.

---

### **Q7. What is the difference between MAC and IP?**

MAC works at Layer 2 and delivers data inside a local network segment. IP works at Layer 3 and enables communication across networks and the internet. MAC is physical, IP is logical and can change.

---

### **Q8. What is ARP?**

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps IP addresses to MAC addresses. When a device wants to communicate within the network, it broadcasts an ARP request to find the target MAC. ARP is essential for local network communication.

---

### **Q9. What is DHCP?**

DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses, gateway, DNS, and subnet mask to devices. It removes the need for manual configuration and ensures no IP conflicts. DHCP also supports lease times for IP lifecycle management.

---

# 🔵 **2️⃣ DNS (Domain Name System)**

---

### **Q10. What is DNS?**

DNS translates human-readable domain names like google.com into IP addresses that machines understand. It acts like the internet’s phonebook. Without DNS, users would need to remember numerical IPs.

---

### **Q11. How does DNS work?**

When you enter a domain, the resolver checks the browser cache → OS cache → router → ISP DNS → root servers → TLD servers → authoritative DNS server. Finally, the IP is returned to the client, enabling the connection.

---

### **Q12. What are different DNS Records?**

* **A:** Domain → IPv4
* **AAAA:** Domain → IPv6
* **CNAME:** Domain alias
* **MX:** Mail servers
* **TXT:** Verification & policies
* **NS:** Nameservers for the domain

---

### **Q13. What is DNS Resolution?**

DNS resolution is the process of converting a domain name into its corresponding IP address. It may involve recursive or iterative queries. The result is cached to reduce future lookup time.

---

### **Q14. What is DNS Caching?**

Caching stores DNS responses locally to speed up future lookups. It reduces DNS traffic and latency. Cached entries expire after a TTL (Time To Live).

---

# 🔵 **3️⃣ NETWORK MODELS**

---

### **Q15. What is the OSI Model?**

OSI is a 7-layer model that standardizes how data moves across networks. Each layer performs specific functions like addressing, routing, or formatting. It helps troubleshoot and design networks systematically.

---

### **Q16. Explain all 7 layers of OSI.**

* **Layer 1 – Physical:** Bits, cables, NICs
* **Layer 2 – Data Link:** MAC, switches, frames
* **Layer 3 – Network:** IP, routing
* **Layer 4 – Transport:** TCP/UDP, segmentation
* **Layer 5 – Session:** Maintains sessions
* **Layer 6 – Presentation:** Encryption, compression
* **Layer 7 – Application:** HTTP, DNS, user apps

---

### **Q17. What is the TCP/IP Model?**

TCP/IP is a practical 4-layer model used in real networking. It includes Network Access, Internet, Transport, and Application layers. Most protocols today follow TCP/IP, not OSI.

---

### **Q18. Difference between OSI vs TCP/IP?**
