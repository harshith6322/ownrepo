### **How Modern Software Products Are Built Using Jira & SDLC Methodologies**

#### **1. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

SDLC is a structured process for developing software with different phases:

1. **Requirement Analysis** - Gather and document requirements.
2. **Planning** - Define scope, timeline, and resources.
3. **Design** - Create architecture and design documents.
4. **Development** - Write code and implement features.
5. **Testing** - Conduct unit, integration, and system testing.
6. **Deployment** - Release software to production.
7. **Maintenance** - Provide support, fix bugs, and update software.

#### **2. Common SDLC Methodologies**

🔹 **Waterfall Model**

- Sequential process (one phase must be completed before moving to the next).
- Suitable for well-defined, small-scale projects.
- **Disadvantages:** Rigid, late testing phase, costly changes.

🔹 **Agile (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)**

- Iterative and incremental development.
- Focus on flexibility, customer feedback, and continuous improvement.
- **Most widely used today** due to adaptability and faster delivery.

#### **3. Scrum Framework (Agile Methodology)**

Jira is heavily used in **Scrum**, which follows:

1. **Sprint Planning** - Define tasks for 1-4 week sprints.
2. **Daily Standups** - Short meetings for progress updates.
3. **Sprint Execution** - Developers complete tasks.
4. **Sprint Review** - Demo features to stakeholders.
5. **Sprint Retrospective** - Analyze what went well and what can improve.

#### **4. Jira in Agile Development**

Jira helps teams:  
✔ Manage user stories & backlog.  
✔ Track sprint progress with Scrum/Kanban boards.  
✔ Automate workflows and integrate with CI/CD tools.  
✔ Generate reports (burn-down charts, velocity reports).

#### **Which is Best? What Is Used Today?**

✅ **Scrum (Agile) is the most widely used approach today.**  
✅ **Jira is the most popular tool** for Agile teams.  
✅ **Waterfall is rare but used in large, fixed-scope projects** (e.g., government, healthcare).
