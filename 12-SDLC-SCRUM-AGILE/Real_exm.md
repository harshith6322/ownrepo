### **1. Project Initiation & Backlog Creation**

**Manager & Product Owner Role**

- **Define the Vision:** The Product Manager and Product Owner meet to outline the goals (e.g., “Increase conversion with personalized recommendations”).
- **Create Epics in Jira:** In Jira, an Epic is created to capture the high-level objective.
- **User Stories:** The Product Owner breaks down the Epic into smaller user stories such as “As a user, I want to see recommended products based on my browsing history.”
- **Prioritization:** The backlog is prioritized based on business impact, technical feasibility, and dependencies.

### **2. Sprint Planning**

**Scrum Master & Team Involvement**

- **Meeting Setup:** The Scrum Master schedules a Sprint Planning meeting with the entire team.
- **Backlog Review:** The team reviews the prioritized user stories in Jira, discussing requirements and acceptance criteria.
- **Estimation & Commitment:** Developers estimate the effort (using story points, for example) and select which stories to pull into the sprint backlog.
- **Task Breakdown:** Each user story is broken down into tasks (e.g., design UI components, set up recommendation engine API, write unit tests) and sub-tasks are created in Jira.
- **Assignment:** Tasks are assigned to developers based on expertise and workload.

### **3. Sprint Execution**

**Daily Work & Communication**

- **Daily Standups:** Every day, the team holds a short standup meeting where each developer reports on:
  - What they accomplished yesterday.
  - What they’re working on today.
  - Any blockers or issues.
- **Task Management in Jira:**

  - Developers update the status of their tasks in Jira (e.g., “To Do,” “In Progress,” “Code Review,” “Done”).
  - Jira’s Scrum or Kanban board provides a visual snapshot of sprint progress.
  - Issues, bugs, or integration challenges are logged and tracked as separate Jira tickets.

- **Collaboration & Integration:**
  - Developers collaborate on shared components (like the recommendation algorithm) and use Jira comments to keep discussions tied to specific tasks.
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools are integrated with Jira, updating tasks automatically as code is merged and deployed.

### **4. Sprint Review & Feedback**

**Demonstrating the Feature**

- **Sprint Review Meeting:**
  - At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates the completed product recommendation feature to stakeholders.
  - Feedback is gathered on usability, performance, and any adjustments needed.
- **Jira Updates:**
  - Completed tasks are marked as “Done” in Jira.
  - Any new issues or enhancements based on feedback are added back into the backlog for future sprints.

---

### **5. Sprint Retrospective**

**Continuous Improvement**

- **Reflection Session:**
  - The team, guided by the Scrum Master, discusses what went well, what challenges were encountered, and what can be improved in the next sprint.
  - Action items (such as improving code review practices or adjusting sprint planning sessions) are documented.
- **Jira as a Documentation Tool:**
  - Retrospective notes and action items can be stored in Jira (or an integrated Confluence space) to track improvements over time.

---

### **Summary of Roles & Flow**

- **Manager/Product Owner:** Define project vision, create and prioritize backlog items in Jira, and ensure alignment with business goals.
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates meetings, ensures agile practices are followed, and helps remove blockers.
- **Developers/QA:** Execute tasks, update Jira, collaborate in daily standups, and work through feedback to refine the feature.

This process not only ensures transparency and continuous feedback but also allows the team to adapt quickly to changing requirements—making Scrum with Jira the most popular approach in today's agile environments.
