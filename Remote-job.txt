## 🧰 **Top Skills That Pay More**

* CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD)
* Kubernetes, Helm
* Terraform & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* AWS (EKS, ECS, EC2, VPC, Load Balancing)
* Docker optimization
* Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
* Security & DevSecOps
* Automation (Python, Bash scripting)

## 🚀 **How to Scale Your Income**

1. **Start small** — fix CI/CD issues, write Dockerfiles, automate deployment.
2. **Get reviews** — early reviews matter more than money.
3. **Build a strong profile** — showcase GitHub projects, real deployments.
4. **Package services** — e.g. “I’ll set up your AWS CI/CD pipeline in 3 days.”
5. **Upskill continuously** — learn cost optimization, IaC, and security — clients pay extra for that.
