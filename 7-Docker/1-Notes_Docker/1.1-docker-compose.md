Here’s a **complete, practical list of Docker Compose commands** (updated for **Docker Compose v2** – `docker compose`, not `docker-compose`).
I’ve grouped them so they’re **easy to remember for interviews + real usage**.

---

# 🔹 Basic Docker Compose Commands

### ▶️ Start services

```bash
docker compose up
```

Run in background (detached):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Rebuild images before starting:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Recreate containers:

```bash
docker compose up --force-recreate
```

---

### ⛔ Stop services

```bash
docker compose down
```

Stop and remove **volumes**:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

Stop and remove **images**:

```bash
docker compose down --rmi all
```

Stop without removing containers:

```bash
docker compose stop
```

---

# 🔹 Status & Monitoring

### 📋 List services status

```bash
docker compose ps
```

### 📜 View logs

```bash
docker compose logs
```

Follow logs (live):

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Logs for specific service:

```bash
docker compose logs frontend
```

---

# 🔹 Build & Image Management

### 🏗️ Build images

```bash
docker compose build
```

Build specific service:

```bash
docker compose build frontend
```

Build without cache:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
```

---

# 🔹 Container Interaction

### 🐚 Exec into running container

```bash
docker compose exec frontend sh
```

For bash:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash
```

### 🚀 Run a one-off command

```bash
docker compose run frontend npm install
```

Run and remove container after execution:

```bash
docker compose run --rm frontend npm test
```

---

# 🔹 Scaling Services

### 🔁 Scale services

```bash
docker compose up --scale frontend=3 -d
```

⚠️ Works only for services **without fixed container_name or ports**

---

# 🔹 Configuration & Validation

### ✅ Validate compose file

```bash
docker compose config
```

Show final merged config:

```bash
docker compose config --resolve-image-digests
```

---

# 🔹 Pull & Push Images

### ⬇️ Pull images

```bash
docker compose pull
```

Pull specific service:

```bash
docker compose pull database
```

### ⬆️ Push images (for registries)

```bash
docker compose push
```

---

# 🔹 Restart & Lifecycle

### 🔄 Restart services

```bash
docker compose restart
```

Restart specific service:

```bash
docker compose restart frontend
```

Pause services:

```bash
docker compose pause
```

Unpause:

```bash
docker compose unpause
```

---

# 🔹 Remove Containers & Resources

### 🧹 Remove stopped containers

```bash
docker compose rm
```

Force remove:

```bash
docker compose rm -f
```

---

# 🔹 Profiles (Advanced, interview ⭐)

Run with profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile dev up
```

Define in compose:

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    profiles: ["dev"]
```

---

# 🔹 Multiple Compose Files

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

---

# 🔹 Environment Files

Use specific env file:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.prod up
```

---

# 🔹 Legacy vs Modern (IMPORTANT)

❌ Old (deprecated):

```bash
docker-compose up
```

✅ New (correct):

```bash
docker compose up
```

---

# 🧠 Must-remember interview facts

✔ Every service **must have image or build**
✔ `docker compose` is a **plugin**, not standalone
✔ YAML does **not evaluate shell expressions**
✔ `version:` is **obsolete** in Compose v2

---

# 🎯 Most-used commands (real-world)

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose down
docker compose logs -f
docker compose exec <service> sh
docker compose build
docker compose ps
```
