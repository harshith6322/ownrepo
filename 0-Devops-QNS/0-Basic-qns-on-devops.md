# DevOps Interview Notes

## 1. DevOps
DevOps is a set of practices, cultural philosophies, and tools that combine software development and IT operations to deliver high‑quality software faster and more reliably.  


## 2. DevSecOps
DevSecOps integrates security into every stage of the software development lifecycle, making security a shared responsibility across development, security, and operations teams.  


## 3. Benefits of DevOps
- Improved collaboration between teams  
- Faster and more frequent delivery  
- Increased reliability and availability  
- Better scalability  
- Enhanced security (when integrated)  
- Reduced lead time for changes and faster recovery

## 4. What do you take into consideration when choosing a tool/technology? 
- Maturity and stability vs. cutting edge  
- Community size and ecosystem (plugins, integrations, support)  
- Architecture (agent vs. agentless, master vs. masterless)  
- Learning curve and team expertise  
- Licensing, cost, and vendor lock‑in  
- Compatibility with existing workflows and CI/CD pipelines

## 5. Can you describe which tool or platform you chose to use in some of the following areas and how?
- CI/CD: Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI, Drone, Argo CD, Zuul  
- Provisioning / IaC: Terraform, CloudFormation  
- Configuration management: Ansible, Puppet, Chef
- Monitoring & alerting: Prometheus, Nagios  
- Logging / log processing: Logstash, Graylog, Fluentd  
- Code review: Gerrit, Review Board  
- Code coverage: Cobertura, Clover, JaCoCo  
- Issue tracking: Jira, Bugzilla  
- Containers & orchestration: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, Nomad  
- Testing frameworks: Robot Framework, Serenity, Gauge

Be prepared to explain why you chose a specific tool and how you used it in practice.

## 6. Differences between DevOps and SRE
- DevOps: cultural/process practices to improve speed and efficiency of development and deployment.  
- SRE: applies software engineering to operations, focusing on reliability, uptime, and scalability of production systems.

## 7. SRE responsibilities
- Define and enforce SLOs/SLIs and manage error budgets  
- Incident response, blameless postmortems, and root cause analysis  
- Automation to reduce operational toil  
- Capacity planning, performance tuning, and reliability engineering  
- Improve monitoring, observability, and alerting
