# 📦 Linux Package Management — APT & DPKG (Complete Notes)

---

## 1️⃣ Package Management Overview

Linux software is managed using **package managers**.

### Two levels of tools (Debian/Ubuntu):

| Level      | Tool   | Purpose                                    |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Low-level  | `dpkg` | Installs `.deb` files                      |
| High-level | `apt`  | Downloads, resolves dependencies, upgrades |

**Relation:**

```
apt → uses dpkg → installs files
```

---

## 2️⃣ What is `dpkg`?

### Definition

`dpkg` is a **low-level package installer** for `.deb` packages.

### Key points

- Installs **local `.deb` files**
- Does **NOT** download dependencies
- Does **NOT** manage repositories
- Does **NOT** auto-upgrade packages

### Example

```bash
sudo dpkg -i file.deb
```

If dependencies are missing → ❌ installation fails

---

## 3️⃣ What is `apt`?

### Definition

`apt` (Advanced Package Tool) is a **smart package manager**.

### Responsibilities

- Downloads packages
- Resolves dependencies
- Talks to repositories
- Verifies GPG signatures
- Upgrades installed software
- Uses `dpkg` internally

### Example

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

Internal flow:

```
apt → download packages
apt → resolve dependencies
apt → call dpkg → install
```

---

## 4️⃣ Repositories (Repos)

### What is a repository?

A **software warehouse** containing:

- Package files
- Metadata
- Version info
- Security signatures

### Repo configuration locations

```text
/etc/apt/sources.list
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list
```

---

## 5️⃣ Default Ubuntu Repositories

Packages like:

- `tree`
- `htop`
- `vim`
- `curl`

👉 Already hosted in **Ubuntu official repositories**

So:

```bash
sudo apt install tree
sudo apt upgrade
```

✔ Works automatically
✔ Updates handled by Ubuntu

---

## 6️⃣ Third-Party Software (Jenkins, MySQL, Docker)

Not included in Ubuntu repos ❌
Must add **official vendor repositories**

Examples:

- Jenkins
- MySQL
- Docker

---

## 7️⃣ Installing Third-Party Software (Standard Process)

### 🔐 Step 1: Add GPG Key (Trust)

```bash
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/vendor-key.asc <key-url>
```

Why?

- Ensures packages are **authentic**
- Prevents tampering

---

### 📍 Step 2: Add Repository (Location)

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/vendor-key.asc] <repo-url> binary/" \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vendor.list
```

This tells apt:

> “Software is available here & trust this key”

---

### 🔄 Step 3: Update Package Index

```bash
sudo apt update
```

What happens:

- Apt reads all repositories
- Downloads metadata
- Verifies signatures

❌ No software installed yet

---

### 📦 Step 4: Install Package

```bash
sudo apt install package-name
```

Now:

- Package downloaded
- Dependencies checked
- Installed using `dpkg`

---

## 8️⃣ Future Updates & Upgrades

### ❓ Will updates be automatic?

✅ **YES**

After repo is added:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

APT will:

- Check vendor repo
- Download newer versions
- Upgrade safely

No manual downloads needed again.

---

## 9️⃣ Important Commands Difference

| Command       | Purpose                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `apt update`  | Refresh package list (metadata only) |
| `apt upgrade` | Install newer versions               |
| `apt install` | Install a package                    |
| `apt remove`  | Remove package                       |
| `apt purge`   | Remove + config                      |
| `dpkg -i`     | Install local `.deb`                 |

---

## 🔟 Recommended Practice (IMPORTANT)

### ❌ Avoid:

```bash
wget package.deb
dpkg -i package.deb
```

### ✅ Prefer:

```bash
apt install package
```

Or:

```bash
apt install ./package.deb
```

(better dependency handling)

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ How to Confirm Package Will Auto-Update

```bash
apt policy package-name
```

Shows:

- Installed version
- Available versions
- Repo source

If repo appears → auto-upgrade works ✅

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ When Apt Will NOT Upgrade a Package

APT won’t upgrade if:

1. Repo removed
2. GPG key expired
3. Repo unreachable
4. Package held

```bash
apt-mark hold package
```

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Dependency Example (Java & Jenkins)

- Jenkins **requires Java**
- You installed Java 21 first
- During install:

```
apt checks → dependency satisfied → proceeds
```

APT always checks dependencies before installing.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Debian vs RedHat Comparison (Quick)

| Debian/Ubuntu  | RedHat/CentOS |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| `.deb`         | `.rpm`        |
| `dpkg`         | `rpm`         |
| `apt`          | `yum / dnf`   |
| `sources.list` | `.repo` files |

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ DevOps Mental Model (Remember Forever)

```
GPG key   → Trust
Repo URL  → Location
apt update → Awareness
apt install → Download + Install
apt upgrade → Keep updated
```

---

## ✅ Final One-Line Summary

> **If software comes from a repository (official or third-party), apt will install and automatically keep it updated for life.**
